## Who Am I :interrobang:
My name is Liav, my nick name is LiaVinci as my favorite personality of all times is Leonardo Da Vinci.
I've been working in the IT industry for almost two years now as Software Engineer and as many of us these days I didn't go to University or College to get a degree, instead I decided to study by myself.

Since I was young I loved computers, whether it was for joy or the actual value they can provide in our productivity and everyday life.

From young age I loved to code as an hobby at least when I wasn't gaming :relaxed: and in high school where I could choose a major it was obvious to me that I will pick Computer Science, there I got exposed to deeper topics,
Object Oriented Programming (OOP), HTTP and Web Development in general, Assembly and how Operation Systems actually work and much more...

After I graduated high school I decided to take programming and software engineering to the next step and try to study beyond what I already know while looking for a job.

As I'm always looking for ways to improve myself and get better at what I'm doing and due to the natural curiosity of humans,
over time I've collected a lot of resources that I want to share so it can be easier for you to start and be focused and what you actually need.

## What is the purpose of this project :v:

I kind of gave this one on the top paragraph about me, but I'll go a bit deeper here.

Computer Science is huge subject, actually as I mentioned at the section about me I used to be a gamer and one things that got me so attracted to Computer Science,
is the fact that it's just like gaming, you are in front of a computer, using mouse and keyboard and if you're tiered from one game (or subject) just move to other one,
as I'm coming from more MMORPG background I can say that usually the possibilities are endless just like in Computer Science, you can simply pick up a new skill, practice it and you can go nuts.

So to recap, the purpose of this project is to share what ever I find helpful, there isn't a single day that I'm not reading and most of the things I do read are either old and out of date,
repeating or simply not true but out of this 90% you can find 10% of good and worth your time content that I usually save in my bookmarks just for future reference, in this repo I will share and explain why I shared with you this bit.

## What will I share with you here :speech_balloon:

I've decided to structure this project in a way that you can filter only what you care about, in each folder you can expect to find different .md files which will contain different type of content.

Books - Articles - Courses / Videos - Other Resources

## How can you benefit from this repository :raised_hands:

There are many ways which you can benefit from this repository:

- Each resource that I'll provide here will be in a form of a list, so you can simply clone this repo, for each resources that you have read / watched -> navigate to the appropriate file -> instead [ ] put [X] and here you go, you got a marked resources for easier way to track your progress.
- You can follow this repository to get notified when I push new commit, this way you'll be able to see all the new content I add and be updated.
- You can always contact me if you have any questions, I love helping others and it will make me happy to see that I actually am  :blush:.
